# Documentation

This repository maintains documentation in two layers:

- [`docs/image/README.md`](docs/image/README.md) — End-user documentation for the Docker image `hybrowse/hytale-server` (Docker Hub, primary) and `ghcr.io/hybrowse/hytale-server` (GHCR mirror) (usage, configuration, operations).
- [`docs/hytale/README.md`](docs/hytale/README.md) — Internal reference notes about the *Hytale dedicated server software* (derived from the official manual and related articles). Not intended as the primary end-user documentation for this Docker image.

## Scope & sources

We aim to keep these docs practical and operations-focused.
For authoritative information, always refer to the official Hytale documentation:
