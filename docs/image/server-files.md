# Server files (manual provisioning)

> [!NOTE]
> **You usually don't need this page.** By default (`HYTALE_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=true`), the container downloads and provisions server files automatically.

Manual provisioning is needed if:

- You are on **Apple Silicon (arm64)** and don't want to use `platform: linux/amd64` emulation
- You want to pin a specific server version
- You prefer full control over file provisioning

---

This Docker image runs the official Hytale dedicated server binaries from a mounted volume.
This repository and image **do not** redistribute proprietary Hytale server binaries or assets.

You must provide these files yourself:

- `Assets.zip`
- the `Server/` folder contents (at minimum `HytaleServer.jar`, plus additional runtime files)

## Option A: Official Hytale Downloader (recommended)

The official docs provide the downloader archive here:

- https://downloader.hytale.com/hytale-downloader.zip

Typical flow:

1. Download and extract the archive.
2. Run the downloader and store the game package zip:

   ```bash
   ./hytale-downloader -download-path game.zip
   ```

3. Extract required artifacts from `game.zip`:

   ```bash
   unzip -o game.zip 'Assets.zip'
   unzip -o game.zip 'Server/*' -d .
   ```

You should now have:

- `./Assets.zip`
- `./Server/` (folder)

## Option B: Copy from Hytale launcher installation

If you have the game installed via the launcher, the official manual documents a directory containing a `Server/` folder and `Assets.zip`.

Documented paths:

- **Windows:** `%appdata%\Hytale\install\release\package\game\latest`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Hytale/install/release/package/game/latest`
- **macOS:** `~/Application Support/Hytale/install/release/package/game/latest`

Copy both artifacts (keep them as a matched set when updating):

- `Assets.zip`
- `Server/` (entire folder)

## Provide the files to the container

Expected volume layout:

- `./data/Assets.zip`
- `./data/server/` (contents of `Server/`)

Example:

```text
./data/
  Assets.zip
  server/
    HytaleServer.jar
    ...
```

If you extracted via Option A, you can provision like this:

```bash
mkdir -p ./data/server
cp -f ./Assets.zip ./data/Assets.zip
cp -a ./Server/. ./data/server/
```

Then start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Notes

- Keep `Assets.zip` and `Server/` in sync when updating.
- Avoid committing these files to source control.
