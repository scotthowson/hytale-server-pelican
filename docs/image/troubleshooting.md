# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them.

> [!WARNING]
> This is the most common issue. If players can't connect, check this first.

## Server authentication error: "Server authentication unavailable"

**Symptom:** Players cannot connect; you see this in server logs:

```text
[SEVERE] [HandshakeHandler] Server session token not available - cannot request auth grant
[INFO] [Hytale] Disconnecting ... with the message: Server authentication unavailable - please try again later
```

**Cause:** The server is not authenticated. In `HYTALE_AUTH_MODE=authenticated` (the default), the server must complete a device-code login after startup before players can connect.

**Fix:**

1. Attach to the server console:

```bash
docker compose attach hytale
```

2. Run:

```text
/auth login device
```

3. Follow the URL + device code shown in the console.

4. If multiple profiles are shown, pick one:

```text
/auth select <number>
```

5. Check status:

```text
/auth status
```

Detach without stopping the server:

- Press `Ctrl-p` then `Ctrl-q`

## Downloader authentication (first-time setup)

**Symptom:** Container logs show a URL + device code on first run.

**Cause:** The official Hytale Downloader uses OAuth device-code flow to authenticate before downloading server files.

**Fix:** Open the URL in your browser and enter the device code shown in the logs. After completion, the download will proceed.

Watch logs during first-time auth:

```bash
docker compose logs -f hytale
```

> [!NOTE]
> On Apple Silicon (arm64), auto-download requires running the container as `linux/amd64`.

## Auto-download fails on arm64 (Apple Silicon)

**Symptom:**

```text
ERROR: Auto-download is not supported on arm64 because the official downloader archive does not include a linux-arm64 binary.
```

**Cause:** The official Hytale Downloader currently only provides a `linux/amd64` binary.

**Fix:** Either:

- Run the container as `linux/amd64` (uses emulation):

  ```yaml
  services:
    hytale:
      platform: linux/amd64
  ```

- Or provision server files manually: [`server-files.md`](server-files.md)

## Permission denied errors on `/data`

**Symptom:**

```text
cp: cannot create regular file '/data/server/./HytaleServer.jar': Permission denied
```

**Cause:** The container runs as `uid=1000` (non-root) by default. If the host directory mounted to `/data` is owned by a different user, the container cannot write to it.

**Fix:** Make the host directory writable for uid 1000:

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/your/data
```

Or, if you want to use a different uid, run the container with a matching user:

```yaml
services:
  hytale:
    user: "1001:1001"
```

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid running as root (`user: "0:0"`) in production.

## Read-only root filesystem

**Symptom:** When running with a read-only root filesystem (e.g., Kubernetes with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`):

```text
WARNING: Could not write to /etc/machine-id (read-only filesystem?)
WARNING: The Hytale server may fail with 'Failed to get Hardware UUID'.
```

**Cause:** The container needs to write a machine-id to `/etc/machine-id`. The Hytale server reads this file for hardware identification.

**Fix (Kubernetes):** Disable read-only root filesystem:

```yaml
securityContext:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
```

The machine-id is persisted to `/data/.machine-id` for stability across restarts.

**Fix (Docker Compose):** Mount `/tmp` as tmpfs if needed:

```yaml
services:
  hytale:
    volumes:
      - /path/to/data:/data
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
```

## Container exits immediately with "Missing server jar" or "Missing assets"

**Symptom:** Container exits with clear error messages about missing files.

**Cause:** The server files and `Assets.zip` are not present in `/data`.

**Fix:**

- Set `HYTALE_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=true` to let the container download them automatically.
- Or provision files manually: [`server-files.md`](server-files.md)

> [!TIP]
> AOT errors are usually harmless with `ENABLE_AOT=auto` (default). The server will continue without AOT.

## AOT cache errors on startup

**Symptom:** Java errors mentioning AOT cache incompatibility or "modules size has changed".

**Cause:** The AOT cache was generated for a different Java version or architecture.

**Fix:**

- Delete the existing cache (`./data/server/HytaleServer.aot`) and regenerate it, or
- Set `ENABLE_AOT=false` to disable AOT.

See: [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#aot-cache)

## High CPU usage from garbage collection

**Symptom:** Server uses a lot of CPU even with few players; GC logs show frequent collections.

**Cause:** The JVM heap is too small for the workload.

**Fix:** Increase `JVM_XMX`:

```yaml
services:
  hytale:
    environment:
      JVM_XMX: "6G"
```

Monitor and experiment with different values.

See: [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#jvm-heap-tuning)
